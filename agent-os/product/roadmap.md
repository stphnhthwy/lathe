# Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP

The bar for MVP is "a developer can write a `capability.yaml`, validate it, serve it as a
local MCP server, talk to it through Claude, and eject a standalone server." We build it as
an **interpreter first** (a generic server reads the manifest at runtime); ejecting to
standalone code comes last.

### M0 — Skeleton ✅
- Publishable npm package: `bin` (`lathe`), `exports`, `files`, `engines`.
- `lathe --help` lists commands; no-args shows usage.

### M1 — Parse + validate ✅
- `lathe check [path]` — load `capability.yaml`, parse YAML, validate the manifest shape
  with a zod schema, report errors clearly (non-zero exit) or confirm it's valid.
- Faithful *structural* validation. Semantic checks (formula grammar, JSONPath in `map`,
  cross-references between sources/tools) are deferred to a later milestone.

### M2 — `init` ✅
- `lathe init <name>` — scaffold `capability.yaml`, `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `.env.example`
  into a new `./<name>/` subdir. The generated manifest is a guided, valid template that
  passes `lathe check` as-is; refuses to overwrite an existing capability.

### M3 — `serve` (interpreter) ✅
- A generic server reads the manifest, registers tools (official MCP SDK, zod input schemas,
  `confirm`/`readonly` annotations), and runs locked compute. Wire the `http` adapter against
  local PostgREST first — the simplest real API — then point the same adapter at real APIs.
- Built in three slices (all done — every tool in the example capability is callable):
  - **Slice 1 — serve + http adapter + atomic tools ✅.** `lathe serve` over stdio; the `http`
    source adapter (`${...}` env, bearer/oauth2 auth, headers, GET/POST, PostgREST query);
    atomic `reads`/`writes` tools registered with `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`. Pipeline and
    metric-reading tools are surfaced as deferred at startup (stderr), not dropped.
  - **Slice 2 — declared pipelines ✅.** Linear `steps` (`call` + `as`, `for_each` fan-out),
    `map` with JSONPath-lite `$.field` + a tiny arithmetic evaluator, `prefer` upsert. `ask`
    fields become the pipeline tool's input. `import_recent` is now callable.
  - **Slice 3 — locked compute ✅.** A tiny formula engine (derived fields, `sum/avg/min/max/
    last`, `Nd` windows, metric funcs like `rolling_load(7d)`, ratios like `acwr`). Metric-reading
    tools fetch their entity's rows via its declared read source and return `computed_locked`
    values **frozen**. `weekly_checkin` is now callable.

### M4 — Connect
- stdio → Claude. Run a real flow by talking to the capability.

### M5 — `build --eject`
- Emit a standalone `SKILL.md` + `mcp-server/` that runs without lathe.

## Phase 2: Post-Launch
- Richer source adapters (OAuth/refresh for real APIs like Strava/Shopify).
- Broader formula grammar before escaping to code.
- npm publish, CI, contribution docs.

## Architectural invariants (hold across all phases)
1. **The manifest declares; lathe executes.** The YAML never runs — lathe reads the
   declaration and runs real code (like Prisma schema → SQL, Dockerfile → image).
2. **Locked compute is returned frozen.** Anything in `behavior.computed_locked` is computed
   in code and returned authoritative; the model reasons about it, never recomputes it.
3. **lathe owns no data.** Data lives in the sources; with `http` sources lathe doesn't even
   define where data lives.
4. **Secrets resolve from the environment (`${...}`) at runtime, never committed.**
5. **Interpret first, eject later.** A generic interpreter proves the mechanism; ejected
   standalone code is an optimization, not the foundation.
6. **The dial is the design.** At every level — value (`formula` vs `ask`), field mapping
   (`declare`/`coerce`/`ask`), orchestration (declared pipeline vs model-chained tools) —
   declare what must be reproducible, defer what needs judgment.

## Decision log
- **Interpreter before ejection** — a manifest-reading server is the cheapest path to a real
  end-to-end loop; standalone emission is mechanical once the interpreter works.
- **`http` is the default source; DB is the fallback** — most capabilities call APIs, not
  databases; a local store is only for data with no home yet.
- **Linear pipelines only** — branching/looping in a declared pipeline is the signal to
  escape to code or to the model, keeping the declarative grammar tiny.
